Environment Settings
====================

In this directory you configure the environments your system running on (e.g. IP addresses, host names, directories).
env.properties contains the default settings for all machines. Create a new file named env.{hostname}.properties or
env.{username}.properties and overwrite the properties for your user or machine.
